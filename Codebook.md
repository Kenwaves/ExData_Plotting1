##Overview
This was build as a part of Module 4 Exploratory Data analysis.
The plots were produced from the dataset Electric power consumption, taken from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/.

##steps
1.*Read* the houseold data is read in and cleaned
2. *Graphing* R functions like hist() and plot() are used to great graphs specified in the assignment
3.*Copy* the graphs are copied onto png files.

##Output Description
The final output includes four png files (width 480, height 480) on the following data
Plot 1: Historgram of the global active power in kilowatts from  2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.
Plot 2: line graph of the global active power in kilowatts from  2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.
Plot 3: line graph comparing energy sub metering from energy sub meterings No.1 to No.3
